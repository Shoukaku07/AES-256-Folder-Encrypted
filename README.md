# FolderEncryptor

FolderEncryptor is a Java program designed to provide file encryption and decryption functionality within a folder using the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm with a user-specified password. This tool is intended for securing sensitive files on your local storage.

## How It Works

FolderEncryptor operates as follows:

### Encryption Process

1. The `encryptFolder` method is invoked with a folder to encrypt and a user-provided password.
2. It recursively traverses the folder structure.
3. For each file encountered, it reads the file's content into `fileBytes`.
4. The `encrypt` method is called with `fileBytes` and the password.
5. Inside the `encrypt` method, a secret key is generated from the user's password.
6. The AES encryption algorithm is initialized with this secret key.
7. The file content (`fileBytes`) is encrypted using AES encryption, resulting in `encryptedBytes`.
8. The encrypted content is written to a new file with the extension `.hidden`.
9. The original file is securely deleted to prevent data leakage.

### Decryption Process

1. The `decryptFolder` method is invoked with a folder to decrypt and the corresponding password.
2. It recursively traverses the folder structure.
3. For each `.hidden` file encountered, it reads its content into `fileBytes`.
4. The `decrypt` method is called with `fileBytes` and the password.
5. Inside the `decrypt` method, the secret key is generated from the provided password.
6. The AES decryption algorithm is initialized with this secret key.
7. The file content (`fileBytes`) is decrypted using AES decryption, resulting in `decryptedBytes`.
8. The decrypted content is written to a new file with the `.hidden` extension removed.
9. The original `.hidden` file is securely deleted.

### Key Generation

- The `generateKey` method creates a 128-bit (16-byte) secret key from the provided password. This key is used for both encryption and decryption. For AES-256 encryption, ensure that your password is 32 bytes long, and consider implementing a secure key derivation function (KDF) for stronger key generation.

### Encryption Algorithm Details

- AES encryption is performed in ECB mode with PKCS5 padding (`"AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding"`).

## How to use it?

You can download the java file that I have provided. then place them in the respective java src, making sure to change the package according to your application.

How to start encrypted?

Encrypted folder containing files:
```java
FolderEncryptor.encryptFolder("/storage/emulated/0/Download", "MyPassword");
```
Decrypted:
```java
FolderEncryptor.decryptFolder("/storage/emulated/0/Download", "MyPassword");
```

How to encrypt 1 file?
```java
File fileToEncrypt = new File("/storage/emulated/0/MyFiles.txt");
String encryptionPassword = "your_password_here";
FolderEncryptor.encryptFile(fileToEncrypt, encryptionPassword);
```
Decrypted:
```java
File decryptFile = new File("/storage/emulated/0/MyFiles.txt");
String decryptPassword = "your_password_here";
FolderEncryptor.decryptFile(decryptFile, decryptPassword);
```

note: You can `custom extension`

## Security Considerations

While this code provides a basic example of file encryption and decryption, it is essential to consider additional security measures for real-world applications:

- Securely storing and managing encryption keys to protect against unauthorized access.
- Handling exceptions and errors gracefully to prevent potential vulnerabilities.
- Ensuring data integrity through methods like message authentication codes (MACs) to guard against tampering.
- Using strong password policies and implementing robust key derivation functions (KDFs) for secure key generation.
